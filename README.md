# msteams-poc

Capstone project creating MS Teams POC app

# Install

We don't really know the proper steps to install this right now. We were forced to create a bot on our individual machines using the Teams Toolkit within VSCode. Once we had a basic bot created, we could then copy the files from the repo and replace them for files the local bot created.

# Testing

Testing icebreakers/other messages should now be run through the api by creating a new scheduled message.
